        <p>I would love to make the app work without JavaScript but I don't know enough back-end to do it ðŸ˜” Want to help? Shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:petar@frontendlane.com">petar@frontendlane.com</a> or submit a Pull Request on <a href="https://github.com/frontendlane/prioritizer">Github</a>.</p>
        <p>If you want to get a sense of what the app looks like, here's a static <a href="./sample-page.html">sample page</a> that doesn't use JavaScript. Note that buttons are disabled because they require JavaScript to work.</p>

                <summary>What is Prioritizer?</summary>
                <div>
                    <p>Prioritizer is something I built to stratch my own itch. I use it to remove cognitive burden of deciding which conflicting goal is more important during development. When starting a new side project I first catalogue all project goals and rank them by priority. Then, during development, when I come across a tradeoff I must make between two project goals I just consult the prioritized list and carry on without interrupting development flow.</p>
                    <p>This is a bit of a niche use-case but I realized that this app can also be good for reminding me of my goals and for helping me direct effort toward more important goals first. For this to reliably work I have yet to develop a habit of starting each coding/study/work session by reviewing my list of project priorities. I have a few ideas how to make it easier to stay in sync with project priorities, for myself and everyone else using the app. For starters I prominently placed a "Print" button so you can print out your priorities and hang them on a wall. ðŸ¤“ In the future I plan to support exporting priorities to <samp>.txt</samp>, <samp>.csv</samp>, and static <samp>.html</samp> files so priorities can fit into whatever flow you adhere to. I also plan to add a few additional features that will collectively transform this app into a light project/task management tool, making it easier to get into the habit of opening the app and reviewing project priotities.</p>

                <summary>How does it work?</summary>
                <div>
                    <p>When you first open the app it shows a list of sample project priorities. Initially, they are ranked from most important to least important using their weight (located toward the end of each row). Weights are distributed by dragging the slider and pressing decrement and increment buttons. At the top of the page is a number next to "Remaining weight" that indicates how much weight you have left to distribute. Note that you don't have to allocate all of it. Total weight depends on the number of priorities. The formula is <span class="formula"><var>numberOfPriorities</var> &times; 3 = <var>totalWeight</var></span>.</p>
                    <p>This app doesn't have "Create an account" or "Register" buttons because those would require a database. I value privacy and anonimity on the web and I don't want the responsibility of handling someone's data. Instead, I do something different. Every time you change something the data is saved to browser's memory (<code>localStorage</code>) so don't worry about closing/restarting the page. The plus side of this approach is that you don't have to spend time registering/logging in. Double win! ðŸŽŠ</p>
                    <p>Feel free to play around with the sample data or delete existing priorities and start adding your own. If you have any suggestions feel free to shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:petar@frontendlane.com">petar@frontendlane.com</a>.</p>
                    <p>PS: It's not obvious, but you can change the project name at the very top of the page. ðŸ™ƒ</p>
